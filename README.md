# Website Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing website performance data to understand user behavior, traffic sources, and engagement patterns. The analysis helps identify which channels bring the most valuable users and how engagement varies across different dimensions.

The project is implemented using **Python** in a Jupyter Notebook environment and applies exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques with visualizations.

---


## 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze website traffic and user engagement metrics
* Compare engagement across different channel groups
* Identify trends and patterns in session behavior
* Support data-driven decisions for improving website performance

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

* **Language:** Python
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
* **Libraries Used:**

  * pandas – data manipulation and analysis
  * numpy – numerical computations
  * matplotlib – data visualization
  * seaborn – advanced statistical visualizations

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Handling missing and inconsistent values
* Aggregation of engagement metrics
* Channel-wise comparison of:

  * Average engaged time per session
  * Session counts
* Visualization using bar charts and plots for clear insights

---

## 📈 Sample Insights

* Certain channel groups show higher average engagement time
* Organic and direct traffic tend to have better session quality
* Engagement varies significantly based on traffic source

*(Exact insights depend on the dataset used)*
